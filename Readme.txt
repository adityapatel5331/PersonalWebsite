The skills  section were made by me refering to the planning part of the assignment.
I learned hr tag in school  and I used it in many places throughout the project almost at the end of each and every page.

For the first page ,
I have used image tag,orderd lists, and nav tag.
And this wil help the browser to display diffrent texts in orderd list format and the image tag helps to diplay image.
Second web page, I have used video tag which will help us to show a video in web page along with the audio tags having controls in webpage.
And the third and last page shows nested list along with two different images.
And websites with diffrent links.
